# FlappyBird
This is the first program that I've made in my life  
and is written in Java in my first year in college

## Problems that need to be solved  
1. The structure is pretty terrible  
2. The name of each class is meaningless

## How to play
1. Simply by just click the window and your flappy bird will begin to fly
2. You need to pass obstacles and get more points as you can as possible
